# Fume Coworking Public Site — Next.js 14 App Router Package

This package converts the cleaned static Fume public-site build into a maintainable Next.js 14 codebase using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, TanStack Query v5, Zod, Vitest and React Testing Library.

## Stack

- Next.js 14 App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for non-sensitive UI state
- TanStack Query v5 for client-side mutations/data operations
- Zod validation on client and server
- Vitest + React Testing Library
- Node 20
- npm

## Motion layer

This version includes a lightweight native CSS motion layer for the public site:

- Branded route loader in `app/loading.tsx`
- Reusable loader component in `components/ui/fume-loader.tsx`
- Animated brand-gradient surface in `components/ui/animated-gradient-panel.tsx`
- Card and CTA micro-interactions in `app/globals.css`
- Global `prefers-reduced-motion` support

No new animation npm package was added. Motion uses only the approved Fume colors and keeps the public SEO pages fast. See `MOTION_ENHANCEMENT_NOTES.md` for the design rationale.

## Preserved public routes

- `/`
- `/locations/`
- `/locations/new-delhi/`
- `/locations/gurugram/`
- `/workspace/`
- `/workspace/open-dedicated/`
- `/workspace/cubicle/`
- `/workspace/private-cabin/`
- `/workspace/day-pass/`
- `/workspace/meeting-room/`
- `/workspace/virtual-office/`
- `/about-us/`
- `/gallery/`
- `/events-at-fume/`
- `/partner-with-us/`
- `/contact-us/`
- `/privacy-policy/`
- `/refund_returns/`
- `/terms-and-conditions/`
- `/shop/`
- `/cart/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/day-pass/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/meeting-room/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/conference-room/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/in-delhi/`
- `/product-category/workspaces/in-gurugram/`
- Existing product booking URLs
- Existing blog URLs

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

## Environment variables

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.fumecoworking.in
FUME_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.fumecoworking.in,https://fumecoworking.in
FUME_LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-secure-lead-endpoint.example.com
```

`FUME_LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` is optional during staging. If it is missing, the lead route accepts the request but does not forward it.

## Important implementation notes

- Reusable modules use named exports.
- Next.js App Router files still use default exports because Next requires default exports for `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `robots.ts`, and `sitemap.ts`.
- All client API calls go through `/lib/api`.
- Lead form validation runs on the client and again in `app/api/leads/route.ts` with Zod.
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used.
- No localStorage is used.
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys are included. Server-only webhook configuration uses `FUME_LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- Images use `next/image` instead of raw image tags in app/components. Test mocks use raw `<img>` only inside test files.
- Gallery is dynamically imported because it is the most interaction-heavy client section.

## Follow-up required before production

1. Connect `/api/leads` to the final CRM/email/Google Sheet/Zapier/Zoho flow.
2. The API route now has a small in-memory rate limit, origin allowlist and honeypot. Add production-grade WAF/rate limiting or CAPTCHA before high-traffic launch.
3. Replace legal placeholder text with legally approved policy copy.
4. Confirm final address, phone, email, social links, workspace capacities and pricing.
5. Connect `/cart/` and product routes to final WooCommerce/booking/payment flow if e-commerce checkout remains required.
6. Add real logo asset if available; current package uses a clean text/mark placeholder.

## New packages included

The project includes the packages required for the stack and testing setup. `@vitejs/plugin-react` is included only to make Vitest process React/TSX tests cleanly.
